# Plating-Tracker

This is a app that tracks and updates when new data is entered.  It is used for watching when trends (high or low plating thicknesses) to help determine whether there is a problem with the plating process.  

In its current state data must be entered manually through the form on the html page.  In its finished form the website will pull from an intranet site where this data is already entered and stored.  The graphs will update upon new entries to that page.  Unfortunately the full working code with company server data and file path locations cannot be uploaded.
