# Plating-Tracker

This is a app that tracks and updates when new data is entered.  It is used for watching when trends (high or low plating thicknesses) to help determine whether there is a problem with the plating process.  

In its current state data must be entered manually through the form on the html page.  The graphs will update upon new entries to that page.  In its finished state the app would pull from a database upon data entry from another page.  I have changed jobs and no longer have access to the database.
